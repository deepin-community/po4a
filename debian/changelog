  * gitlab-ci: disable job build-any.

  [ Dr. Tobias Quathamer ]
  * New upstream version 0.59.1
    - po4a tool: Really fix --srcdir and --destdir handling
      (Closes: #960892 again). Even with the previous fix,
      the aptitude package was still broken.
    - Sgml: Sort the attributes. Without this, msgids are
      randomly fuzzied. (Closes: #725931, #810988)

po4a (0.59-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niko Tyni ]
  * Add dependencies on libpod-parser-perl.
    This anticipates changes in Perl 5.32: Pod::Parser has been removed
    from the core distribution in the 5.31 series and is being packaged
    separately for Debian.
    The Perl 5.30 package in Debian already Provides libpod-parser-perl,
    so the dependencies don't need to wait for the separate package.

  [ Dr. Tobias Quathamer ]
  * New upstream version 0.59
    - po4a tool: Fix --srcdir handling. This bug was breaking the build
      of several packages, including dpkg. (Closes: #960892)
    - Addendum: New mode 'eof' to easily add at the end of the file
      (Closes: #960949).

po4a (0.58-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.58
    - Do not touch source dir when --destdir is provided (Closes: #602387)
    - Add support for addendum path in po4a_paths (Closes: #823189)
    - Use UTF-8 by default (the 20th century is over)
      po4a used to prefer ascii unless it proved impossible. But the
      underlying detection would fail, possibly for document containing
      UTF-8 chars composed on printable ascii chars only. (Closes: #862460)
    - Add new patch to fix FTBFS.
      Cherry-picked from upstream commit 5db0060.
  * Update d/copyright
  * d/copyright: Remove unneeded license paragraph for GPL-3.0+

po4a (0.55-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 0.55
    - Failing HTML test has been removed upstream
    - Sgml: Avoid deprecated unescaped left brace in regex to get ready
      for Perl 5.32. (Closes: #903735)
    - TransTractor: Ensure to split lines before addendum operation without
      loss or addition of newline. With this change, addendum behavior is
      more intuitive. (Closes: #518218)
    - Xml, Docbook: Document XML tag behavior customization with example
      to help use case specific customization. (Closes: #515763)
  * Add texlive-latex-base to Build-Depends. The latex test needs the
    file 'article.cls' which is included in that package.
  * Add two more files to package's documentation
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.2.1, no changes needed

      in some markdown titles (Closes: #894977).
    - Man: Support .MT and .ME macros for e-mail address
      markup (Closes: #900965).
    - Text: Fix the parsing of fortunes files, which had been broken since
      v0.43. The handling has changed a bit, all msgids are now marked as
      "no-wrap", because the word wrap in fortunes files usually matters.
      This upstream fix has already been cherry-picked for the
      Debian upload of 0.53-2.
  * Use wrap-and-sort
  * Do not run failing HTML module test
  * Remove some example files, no longer distributed
