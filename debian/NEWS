po4a (0.73-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Starting with v0.70, po4a enforces stricter rules regarding encodings.
    Before, it was relying on the default Perl behavior to do "the right
    thing", happily parsing latin-1 or UTF-8 files and converting to the Perl
    internal string representation. The drawback was that this setup forced
    po4a to convert back and forth internally after reading and before
    writing.

    The v0.70 code uses PerlIO to handle all encoding issues automatically,
    removing all manual conversions in the code of po4a. However, this
    requires users to specify the used encoding more precisely.

    This new behavior broke the build of several Debian packages. In some
    cases, it was just the result of po4a being less forgiving about user
    configuration (e.g. Debian's #1072643). In Debian's #1073038, it was that
    po4a made a difference between utf8 and UTF-8 in the encoding
    specification embedded in a POD file. There is no such difference in this
    context, only in Perl internals: utf8 is lax parsing while UTF-8 is picky
    parsing, but both lead to the same result if the file is correctly
    encoded following the UTF-8 standard. po4a now takes UTF-8 (picky parsing)
    in both cases for POD files.
